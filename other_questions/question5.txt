Q5) Discuss . Multi-processing and Multi-threading in Python. What is GIL?
Answer:
In CPython, the global interpreter lock, or GIL, is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This lock is necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe.

In multi-threading a python process spawns one or more threads which shares the same memory space but all them wait for the single core assigned to the main process.

In Multi-Processing, more than one worker processes are created which can utilize the all the cores available on the system.
